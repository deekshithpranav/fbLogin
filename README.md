# Login With Facebook

This project aims at enabling a Web Application to allow users to login using their Facebook Account.

The project uses OAUTH 2.0 and Facebook's manual login option to proceed with the login where possible customizations were implemented. 

This project was observed in a local host environment with the help of node.js server built with express server framework but it can be switched to a live web-app with some tweaks mentioned in the respective file's comments.

This repository consists of the client side files of the login application which includes the index.js to get the server up and running and the app.js linked to the html file to give functionality to the button and proceed with the login on user click.

## Installation and Usage
The code and modules can be downloaded and can be used with the dependencies for the node.js application by configuring them in the bash as follows.
```bash
npm install
```

Then it is followed by running the index.js file which starts the server at the port specified.
```bash
nodemon index.js
```
